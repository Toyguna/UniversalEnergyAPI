# UniversalEnergyAPI

## What is Universal Energy API?
Universal Energy API is an API for Fabric. 
The aim of the API is for users to easily
create, work and interact with energy 
units. Since different energy units can
be created, energy units may be ported
between Fabric and other Modloaders.

The API also provides support for basic 
and complex interactions with energy 
units via blocks, items et cetera.
( for instance: energy storage, cable 
blocks, machines and chargable items. )


## Conventions
The conventions are left for users to
shape:
 - How much X unit of energy will the Y
fuel generate with the Z method?
 - How much X unit of energy will be
consumed to create the Y item with the Z
method?
 - . . .

In addition, a universal energy unit could
be created like RF, EU, FE (Forge/Fabric
Energy!!)


## Documentation
It should be noted that many methods and
functions are present with the API to
reduce time spent doing common things like
unit conversion.
